# Doorman's Box of Tricks

A very simple tool that automates enumeration.
The tool can either be deployed to a target machine (after gaining access) or run on your local machine.
More tools can be added if need be. Most of the options have generic commands they run. You may need to modify or run the tool natively to be more specific. Edit to your hearts content. 

**Note** :
This program requires python to be installed on your machine (or the targets). This program is also best used within a offensive security Linux OS like Kali. Many of the tools are pre-loaded witin Kali so it will be easier to use this tool witin Kali.
