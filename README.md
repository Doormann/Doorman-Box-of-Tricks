# Doorman's Box of Tricks

A very simple tool that automates enumeration.
The tool can either be deployed to a target machine (after gaining access) or run on your local machine.
More tools can be added if need be. Most of the tools have generic commands they run. Edit to your hearts content. 

**Note** :
This program required python to be installed on your machine (or the targets).

# Open those doors!!!
